# pythonics üêç
My Personal Project repository, all written in 3.7.

Pythonic means code that doesn't just get the syntax right but that follows the conventions of the Python community and uses the language
in the way it is intended to be used. This resonates with me until I do some real projects here. Mostly looking for Data manipulation and generally cool python best practices/unconventional tricks for clean automation scripts in the future.
